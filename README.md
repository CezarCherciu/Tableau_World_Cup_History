#Steps:

1. Find an idea >>
I thought that football should be a more easy to approach field as it is probably one of the first points of contact with statistics while playing football manager and similar games as a kid.

2. Find the appropriate dataset >>
I found the dataset on Kaggle that seemed to cantain data with potential connections to the current pandemic situation and the prohibition of fans gathering on stadiums, as well as other interesting stats.

3. Edit the dataset >>
In order to obtain averages for KPI's such as attendance numbers or goals scored per match I had to edit the excel file so that the work in Tableau would come easily

4. Vizualization >>
The final Tableau work book contains:

8 Worksheets Story
- Host Countries
- Match Attendances
- Average Match Attendance
- Number of Games Played
- Goals Scored
- Average Goals Scored per Match
- World Cup Champions
- Finalist

1 Story
- History

5. Observations >>
- On the Host Countries Worksheet, we don't see on the map the 2002 event as it was co-hosted by Japan and South Koreea 
- Due to WW2, we don't have any Competitions held in 1942 and 1946
- Germany appears as two different countries (West Germany and Germany after the reunification), which should be taken into account when looking at the number of titles won or final appearences
- The average number of goals tends to decrease in time, signaling the change from a more romantic epoque of football where all players were focused on attacking and scoring goals to a more modern game with more focus on defence, tactics and organisation.
